Introduction
========================================================

This is the course project **"Developing Data Products"** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products).

The idea is to demostrate **R caret package** capabilities with **Shiny** by building different predictive models with **Wage dataset** in ISLR package.

- The **caret package** is a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models. For more details please visit <http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/>.
- The **Wage dataset** which contains wage and other data for a group of 3000 workers in the Mid-Atlantic region was manually assembled by Steve Miller from the March 2011 [Supplement to Current Population Survey data](http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/TheDataWeb).
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a web application framework for R.

Predictive Models
========================================================
In this project, we built different models, including **generalized linear model**, **random forests** and **gradient boosting** to predict wage from other predictors.

For example, building **generalized linear model** with caret is as below:

```{r}
library(caret)
library(ISLR)
mod <- train(wage~., data = Wage, method = "glm")
print(mod)
```

UI Layout
========================================================

***
In the Shiny web application, various UI options are provided for users to customize traning models and related parameters.

Customized options are provided in left sidebar panel, including:

- **random seed**: for result reproducibility.
- **data partition**: split dataset into two groups for training and testing model respectively.
- **predictors**: variables to predict wage. If nothing selected, predict with all variables.
- **training models**: select predictive model.

By changing the settings, users can observe and study the changes in predition results and the impact of each parameters.

Prediction Results
========================================================

The results are shown in three tab panels, include:
- **Prediction**: use trained model to predict wage in test dataset and show both training and testing RMSE for comparison.
- **Summary**: provide details of model building.
- **Final Model**: show summary and plots generated from final model.
